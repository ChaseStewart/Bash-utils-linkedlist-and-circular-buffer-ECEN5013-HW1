# ECEN5013-HW1
Git Repository for the initial Homework Assignment of ECEN 5053: Advanced Practical Embedded Software

## Maintained By:
[Chase E Stewart](chst9148@colorado.edu)

## Overview:
This repository holds two bash utilities (build_kernel and system_info) as well as two separate C libraries for a circular buffer and a doubly-linked list.


The C libraries follow the CU Boulder Embedded Systems Engineering C-Coding and HDL Style Guideline.

## Usage:
For the bash utilities, add them to your path, or use my [common_deploy ansible script](https://github.com/ECEN5013_common_deploy), and then use `system_info` or `build_kernel` to run.

For the C libraries, link them into a project and then use their provided functions.
